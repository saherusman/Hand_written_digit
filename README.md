# Hand_written_digit
Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits with 
high accuracy. 
 Utilized the MNIST dataset for training and testing, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing 
images. 
 Performed data preprocessing 
 Built and optimized the CNN architecture using frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras, incorporating layers like 
fully connected layers. 
 Visualized training progress using metrics like loss and accuracy curves to monitor model performance.
